A fully offline voice typing app for Android. Speak into your phone and text appears in any app — no internet required, no cloud processing, your voice data never leaves your device.

<b>Features</b>

<b>Offline Speech Recognition</b>
Uses the Parakeet TDT v3 neural model running locally via sherpa-onnx. Supports 26+ languages with auto-detection. No internet connection needed after the initial model download.

<b>Works in Any App</b>
Uses Android Accessibility API to inject text directly into any focused text field. Falls back to clipboard if no text field is focused.

<b>Multiple Input Methods</b>
• Accessibility Button — System navigation bar button, works system-wide
• Floating Mic Button — Draggable overlay, always visible
• Keyboard Integration — Works with keyboards like HeliBoard

<b>Voice Message Transcription</b>
Share or open audio files from any app to transcribe them. Supports OPUS, AAC, OGG, M4A, MP3, WAV formats. Optional folder monitoring watches your Downloads folder for new voice messages.

<b>Word Corrections</b>
Custom dictionary to fix recurring recognition errors. Define rules like "Tamtam" → "Tamdam" and they're applied automatically.

<b>Privacy First</b>
All speech processing happens locally on your device. No audio data is ever sent to any server. No analytics, no tracking.
